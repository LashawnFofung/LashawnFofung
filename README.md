<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
I am a strategic and client-focused business management professional with a strong background across healthcare, software development, IT, and project management. My journey into project management began with organizing family trips and events, and managing my academic and career paths. Over the years, this initial spark has evolved into a refined skill set and deepened expertise. I excel in managing complex IT projects using Agile and Waterfall methodologies. My approach ensures compliance with SDLC standards and drives cross-functional alignment to deliver high-quality solutions on time. My expertise in data analytics, software development, and project management is complemented by a commitment to continuous learning. This dedication helps me effectively address challenges and provide valuable client solutions.

My recent experiences include leading Scrum teams at United Health Group - Optum, where I managed sprint planning, resource allocation, and stakeholder collaboration. These roles honed my proactive problem-solving skills, communication abilities, and capacity to manage multiple priorities, consistently driving successful project outcomes.

In addition, I have completed immersive simulations in AI Product Management, GRC, and Cloud Computing. These projects, including PWCâ€™s Digital Assurance & Transparency Job Simulation and designing scalable AWS cloud architectures, have sharpened my skills in client communication, control design assessment, AWS architecture, data analysis, and UX enhancement.

I am passionate about fostering collaborative relationships with diverse stakeholders and creating a supportive, results-oriented workplace. Promoting diversity and inclusion is a core value, and I thrive in environments that encourage continuous learning.

<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

<h2>Portfolio - Data Analysis Projects</h2>
       In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

<h2></h2>

<h3>Analyzing the Drug Market</h3>
         
**Code:** [Drug Market Analysis](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/Drug-Market-Analysis)
         
**Goal:** To determine which strategy, new drug development or existing drug modification, will maximize expected financial value for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) amidst market uncertainty and new competition.
         
**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset related to drug line development strategies for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC). It involved evaluating potential outcomes, probabilities, and payoffs for three strategic actions: new drug development, existing drug modification, and no change. The analysis aimed to provide a data-driven recommendation for MPC's drug line development plan, minimizing risk and maximizing potential returns in a complex market. 
         
**Skills:** Data Analysis , Decision Tree Analysis , Expected Value Calculation , Strategic Decision-making Under Uncertainty
         
**Technology:** Excel Data Analysis, Decision Tree Analysis
         
**Results:** Using decision tree analysis, the "Existing Drug Line" strategy was identified as the most financially advantageous option, yielding the highest expected financial value of $3,870.02. This significantly outperformed developing a new drug line ($2,763.08) and maintaining the current approach ($868.39). The analysis strongly recommends that Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) immediately prioritize and allocate resources to the modification of its Existing Drug Line.

<h3>Analyzing the Impact of Wellness Participation on Nurse Attrition Rate</h3>
            
**Code:** [Nurse Attrition Linear Regression Analysis](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/Nurse-Attrition-Linear-Regression-Analysis)
            
**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute to nurse attrition, specifically evaluating the impact of an Employee Well-being Program on nurse retention within a major healthcare system
            
**Description:** This project focused on analyzing a dataset of 36 months of Employee Well-being Program participation rates and corresponding nurse attrition rates within a major healthcare system. The objective was to investigate if a statistically significant linear relationship exists between monthly program participation and nurse attrition, and to inform future retention strategies. Linear regression was employed to quantify this relationship, generate a predictive model, and assess statistical significance.
            
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling
            
**Technology:** Excel Data Analysis
            
**Results:** Using linear regression analysis, a statistically significant negative relationship was identified between the Employee Well-being Program's participation rate and nurse attrition rates (p < 0.01). The model revealed that approximately 75% of the variation in nurse attrition rate can be explained by the variation in program participation rate, indicating a moderate to strong fit (R-squared = 0.7485). The derived linear equation, "Predicted Nurse Attrition Rate = -0.081453147 * Program Participation Rate + 5.268268323," indicates that for every 1% increase in program participation, the nurse attrition rate is predicted to decrease by approximately 0.081%. These findings support the hospital's continued investment in and strategic enhancement of the Employee Well-being Program to stabilize its nursing workforce and reduce turnover costs.
