<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
I am a strategic and client-focused business management professional with a strong background across healthcare, software development, IT, and project management. My journey into project management began with organizing family trips and events, and managing my academic and career paths. Over the years, this initial spark has evolved into a refined skill set and deepened expertise. I excel in managing complex IT projects using Agile and Waterfall methodologies. My approach ensures compliance with SDLC standards and drives cross-functional alignment to deliver high-quality solutions on time. My expertise in data analytics, software development, and project management is complemented by a commitment to continuous learning. This dedication helps me effectively address challenges and provide valuable client solutions.

My recent experiences include leading Scrum teams at United Health Group - Optum, where I managed sprint planning, resource allocation, and stakeholder collaboration. These roles honed my proactive problem-solving skills, communication abilities, and capacity to manage multiple priorities, consistently driving successful project outcomes.

In addition, I have completed immersive simulations in AI Product Management, GRC, and Cloud Computing. These projects, including PwCâ€™s Digital Assurance & Transparency Job Simulation and designing scalable AWS cloud architectures, have sharpened my skills in client communication, control design assessment, AWS architecture, data analysis, and UX enhancement.

I am passionate about fostering collaborative relationships with diverse stakeholders and creating a supportive, results-oriented workplace. Promoting diversity and inclusion is a core value, and I thrive in environments that encourage continuous learning.
